A numpy array data_np contains the following columns:

- Columns 0-9: Softmax outputs
- Column 10: True class
- Column 11: Predicted class
- Column 12: Distance to true class centroid
- Column 13: Distance to predicted class centroid

Where every row is related to a prediction of a Convolutional Neural Network trained on the MNIST dataset.

Notice the columns are 0 indexed.

The predictions contained in data_np are for the English Handwritten Characters "MNISTified" dataset, i.e. the original dataset was conformed to look like examples in the MNIST dataset. Classes are alphanumberic characters 0-9, A-Z, a-z, totalling 62 character classes.

A row for a numeric character looks like:

data_np[0]
array([9.97543097e-01, 1.33918874e-07, 5.63467984e-05, 4.57849190e-08,
       1.05705431e-05, 5.70987027e-07, 1.13680355e-04, 1.48702784e-05,
       5.67646348e-05, 2.20390572e-03, 0.00000000e+00, 0.00000000e+00,
       6.83514517e-03, 6.83514517e-03])
       
Where the highest value from columns 1 to 10 (indexed 0 to 9) is at index 0, meaning class index 0, which corresponds to digit 0 was predicted.
Column 10 is the true class 0 and column 11 is the predicted class is also 0, meaning the prediction is correct.
Column 12 is the distance to the true class "centroid" in a 10-dimensional space, where every MNIST class has a centroid, correponding to the average of all correctly predicted digits.
Column 13 is the distance to the predicted class centroid. Since the prediction is correct, the values in columns 12 and 13 are the same.

      
A row for an alphabetic character looks like:

data_np[2000]
array([2.63437442e-02, 1.03594437e-04, 9.70119774e-01, 5.44607701e-06,
       7.29561900e-04, 7.71395491e-07, 1.38946300e-04, 2.03652121e-03,
       2.20767644e-04, 3.00990214e-04, 3.60000000e+01, 2.00000000e+00,
                  nan, 2.72227570e-02])
                  
Is the case, the highest softmax output value is at index 2 meaning the model predicted digit 2. 
Column 10 is the true class 36, which corresponds to the letter "a".
Column 11 is 2, meaning the model predicted the "a" is 2.
Column 12 is nan, because there is no centroid for "a".
Column 13 is the distance to centroid 2.

I need to create data for a table showing for alphabetic characters only, where:
Column 1 is "Threshold": distance to class centroid, with values 0.9 to 0.1 in decrements of 0.1, and 0.05.
Columns 2 to 11 are digits 0 to 9. Column 12 is "TBT" (Total below threshold) and Column 13 is "TAT" (Total above threshold).

Append a function to scripts/helper_functions.py that takes data_np as an argument, and returns an array with the data for the table. 
Append code to scripts/mnist_alphabetic_character_analysis.py to call the function you created.

If you have any doubts, ask.
